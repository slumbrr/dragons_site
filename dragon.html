                A storyteller’s favorite antagonist, the European dragon is
                often depicted as wicked, greedy, and merciless. Evil sorcerers
                would take their form, they would be servants of evil, and dragons
                would, most commonly, kidnap the kingdom’s fair princess. The trademark
                fire breathing is a major factor in classing this kind of beast
                . The other prominent feature is its six limbs; four legs and two wings.
                Usually red or green, they had been mankind’s most dangerous enemy since
                the Middle Ages. In folktales, dragon's blood often contains unique powers,
                keeping them alive for longer or giving them poisonous or acidic properties.

                The modern western image of a dragon developed in western Europe during the
                Middle Ages through the combination of the snakelike dragons of classical
                Graeco-Roman literature, references to Near Eastern European dragons preserved
                in the Bible, and western European folk traditions.
                This popular depiction has held strong throughout centuries; a common
                interaction is its part as a seemingly unstoppable beast in the famous story
                Beowulf. Industrial profiteers would use dragons in posters to dissuade riots,
                governments would print posters their armies taking down the serpent as a show
                in confidence during war, and popular media like The Lord of The Rings and Game
                of Thrones feature them as proficient fiends.
                <br />
                Aside from this darker image, the dragon was very popular in representing military
                family crests for its pride and strength. Being compared to a dragon was paramount
                to having the strength of a god. Christian texts hold stories of various dragon
                slayers that are greatly revered, like the popular Saint George.
                Scholars believe that the fire-breathing element of dragons came
                from medieval depictions of the mouth of hell; for example, art b
                y Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, among others. The entrance to hell
                was often depicted as a monster's literal mouth, with the flames and
                smoke characteristic of Hades belching out. If one believes not only in
                the literal existence of hell, but also the literal existence of dragons
                as Satanic, the association is quite logical.
