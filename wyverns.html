                The physical resemblance between Wyverns and dragons has led many people
                to believe that these creatures come from the same family. That may be true,
                but they are still very different species with important physical differences.
                First and foremost, Wyverns have two legs, whereas dragons have four (or in
                some ancient descriptions, none). The smaller serpent’s legs are also more
                birdlike—long and spindly, with widespread toes and sharply curved talons—where
                a dragon’s legs are reptilian. Not only do their legs give them a unique look,
                they also give them a unique style of movement, hopping, hovering, and pouncing
                instead of crawling. Whether or not the little serpents can breathe fire is hotly
                debated. Certainly, they don’t contain an inexhaustible supply of fire, like the
                mighty dragon does, but some texts do describe Wyverns spouting small balls of
                flame at their enemies or onto a straw roof. They have even been nicknamed
                “fire-drakes” in some Medieval bestiaries.
                The Wyverns deadliest weapon of all is their breath. Even if they can’t breathe
                fire, they can breathe something far more dangerous: pestilence. They spread
                contagious disease wherever they go, and during Europe’s dark ages, they were
                blamed for spreading the Black Plague, a grotesque disease that claimed millions
                of lives.

                Although the first depiction of a Wyvern has been lost to history, it is clear
                from bestiaries and alchemy texts that these little dragons were well-known
                throughout Europe as early as the medieval period, in the fifth century AD.
                Some scholars have speculated that the Wyvern may have sprung from Roman war
                banners, which would have been seen by the early Europeans when Rome’s conquering
                forces began to spread north. This idea is supported by the fact that the 
                etymology of the word “wyvern” can be traced back, through French, to the
                Latin word “vipera,” which would have been used by Romans.
                
                Unlike their dragon counterparts, the media where Wyverns reign supreme is 
                the world of video games. Countless titles have used the creatures as enemies, mounts,
                and even characters. They're impressive structure and fierce personalities make them attractive
                in this field.
