                A number of legends concerning the origin of
                the dragon emerged in the course of Chinese history, 
                of which the Totem-Worship 
                Theory is more popular than the others.
                The Yellow Emperor (Huangdi, a legendary tribal leader) launched a
                series of wars against nine tribes on the Yellow River Valley, and
                incorporated the other tribes' totems into his own dragon totem after 
                defeating them.
                This explains why the dragon has attributes belonging to nine other
                creatures: eyes like a shrimp, antlers like a deer, a big mouth like a 
                bull, a nose like a dog, whiskers like a catfish, a lion's mane, a long
                tail like a snake, scales like a fish, and claws like a hawk.

                The Chinese dragon is a symbol of wisdom, power, and luck in Chinese culture.
                Unlike western dragons, these dragons are usually seen as benevolent and kind.
                Dragons have long been a symbol in Chinese folklore and art. Temples and shrines
                have been built to honor them. Instead of breathing fire and poison, they instead
                are said to control the waters and earth. They fly in the sky among clouds. Most
                pictures of Chinese dragons show them playing with a flaming pearl.
                Legend has it that the pearl gives them their power and allows them
                to ascend into heaven.
                <br />
                Chinese dragons have serpentine bodies, four legs, and are usually without wings.
                They are said to be a composite of various other animals-the body of a snake,
                the antlers of a deer, the talons of an eagle, the soles of a tiger, the scales
                of a carp, and the eyes of a demon. It is said that Chinese dragons have 117
                scales.
                They are usually depicted with four toes. In the traditional symbol of the
                emperor, the dragon is depicted with five. In Japan, dragons are depicted with
                three toes.
                There are a total of nine types of classical dragon: <i>
                    Tianlong, Shenlong, Fucanglong,
                    Dilong, Yinglong, Qiulong, Panlong, Huanglong,
                </i> and <i>Long Wang</i>.
