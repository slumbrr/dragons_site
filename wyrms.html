                Also known as "sea serpents", wyrms resemble monstrous snakes, lacking any limbs.
                Instead they intimidate others with the use of it's impressive size and powerful body.
                Wyrms have thick, serpentine bodies with a head shaped like a horse or a
                crocodile. Some have horns, dangerously large fangs, and bright, wide eyes.
                They're commonly found through the United Kingdom, France, and other parts of
                Western Europe.
                Wyrms were the earliest form to be recorded as a type of dragon. In antiquity
                and in the bible, dragons were imagined as huge serpentine monsters, which means
                that the image of a fire-breathing dragon with four/two legs and wings came much
                later—in the late Middle Ages; Most of the stories say that they live in the sea,
                the Babylonian myths of Tiamat, the myth of the Hydra, Scylla, Cetus and Echidna
                in the Greek mythology and maybe even the Leviathan, confirm that.

                Compared to other Dragon Types, the attribution of supernatural powers
                afford to Wyrms is limited, but it is common for wurms to have the ability 
                to exhale noxious fumes or fire and to move with incredible speed.
                Unlike the other Dragon Types that have redeeming qualities, Wyrms are always destructive
                and malicious towards people. They can be found in swamps, marshes,
                and other dank or wet places, and sometimes they take up home in
                a lake or even a well.
